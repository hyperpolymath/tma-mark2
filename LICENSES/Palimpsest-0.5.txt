THE PALIMPSEST LICENSE
Version 0.5 (December 2024)
================================================================================

A philosophical framework for consent-based digital creation.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PREAMBLE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A palimpsest is a manuscript where old text has been scraped away to make room
for new writing, yet traces of the original remain visible beneath. This
license embraces that metaphor: acknowledging that all creative works build
upon what came before, while honoring the original voices that echo through.

In an age of artificial intelligence and mass data collection, we believe
explicit consent and attribution are fundamental human rights. This license
articulates principles for ethical digital creation.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CORE PRINCIPLES
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. CONSENT
   All uses of creative works for AI training, data mining, or derivative
   generation require explicit, informed consent from the original creator.
   Silence is not permission. Terms of service are not consent.

2. ATTRIBUTION
   Every creative work carries its lineage. Contributors should be credited
   in a manner proportional to their contribution. Metadata and attribution
   chains must be preserved through transformations.

3. COMPASSION
   Technology should reduce suffering, not amplify it. Works released under
   this framework should not be used to harm, deceive, or manipulate humans.
   The purpose of creation is to enrich, not exploit.

4. REVERSIBILITY
   Where possible, actions taken with digital works should be undoable.
   Creators should retain the ability to withdraw consent for future uses.
   No work is so valuable that it justifies permanent loss of control.

5. TRANSPARENCY
   Hidden behaviors, undisclosed data collection, and obfuscated purposes
   violate the spirit of consent. All parties should clearly understand
   what happens to their contributions.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
AI TRAINING PROVISIONS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Works released under this framework MAY NOT be used to train AI/ML models
unless:

a) The creator has given explicit, documented consent for such use
b) The training dataset clearly identifies Palimpsest-licensed works
c) Attribution is preserved in any model outputs derived from these works
d) Creators can request removal of their works from future training

If you train an AI model using Palimpsest-licensed works:
- You must maintain a registry of consent
- You must honor withdrawal requests within 90 days
- You must provide attribution in model cards and documentation

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
THE LIVING ARCHIVE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This license encourages (but does not mandate) contribution to human knowledge
through:

a) Preservation of works in open archives
b) Sharing of provenance and creation metadata
c) Documentation of the creative process
d) Contribution back to the commons

The goal is not restriction but enrichment: ensuring that the wellspring of
human creativity remains accessible to future generations.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
INTERPRETATION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This license is designed to complement, not replace, existing open source
licenses. It provides ethical guidelines that go beyond legal requirements.

When used as an overlay (e.g., "AGPL-3.0-or-later + Palimpsest-0.5"):
- The underlying license provides legal enforcement
- Palimpsest provides ethical guidance
- In case of conflict, the underlying license takes precedence for legal matters
- Palimpsest principles inform interpretation of ambiguous cases

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
