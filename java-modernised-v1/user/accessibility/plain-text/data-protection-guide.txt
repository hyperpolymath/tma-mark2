Open University policy and UK GDPR law require you to delete student data.

This guide explains what to delete, when to delete it, and how to do so safely.

================================================================================
SECTION 1: WHAT DATA MUST BE DELETED
================================================================================

Student Work:

You must delete these types of student work files:
TMA submissions, which are the original files students send you.
Marked copies of assignments with your annotations.
PT3 feedback forms containing your comments.
Any annotated or commented documents.
Draft feedback you have written.

Personal Information:

You must delete these types of personal information:
Student names.

Phone numbers.
Any other information that identifies a student.

Communication Records:

You must delete these types of communication:
Emails to and from students.
Tutorial notes that contain student names.
Assignment queries that include student identifiers.

================================================================================
SECTION 2: WHEN TO DELETE
================================================================================

After Module Completion:
When a student completes a module, keep their data for a maximum of one year,
then delete everything.

After Student Withdrawal:
When a student withdraws from a module, delete their data within one year of
their withdrawal date.

After Student Transfer:
When a student transfers to another tutor, delete their data immediately after
you complete the handover to the new tutor.

During Complaints or Appeals:
If there is a complaint or appeal in progress, keep the relevant data until
the matter is resolved, then delete within one year.

Annual Review:
At the end of each academic year, review all stored data to identify what
should be deleted.

================================================================================
SECTION 3: HOW TO DELETE USING eTMA HANDLER
================================================================================

The eTMA Handler includes a data sanitisation tool. Follow these steps:

Step 1: Run the etmaHandler script from your terminal or applications menu.

Step 2: From the main menu, choose option 5, which is Data protection -
Sanitise student data.

Step 3: The tool will show you what files are present in your etmas folder.

Step 4: Choose one of these options:
Option 1 lets you preview what would be deleted without making changes.
Option 2 lets you delete a specific course folder.
Option 3 lets you delete all student data.
Option 4 lets you delete only the returns folder.

Step 5: Confirm your choice when prompted. For full deletion, you must type
DELETE ALL DATA to confirm.

================================================================================
SECTION 4: BEFORE YOU DELETE
================================================================================

Before deleting any data, verify the following:

Checklist item 1: All marked work has been uploaded to the Open University.

Checklist item 2: No outstanding student appeals or queries require the files.

Checklist item 3: The one-year retention period has passed.

Checklist item 4: You do not need the files for any legitimate purpose.

================================================================================
SECTION 5: WHAT YOU MAY KEEP
================================================================================

You are allowed to keep the following:

Your own teaching notes, as long as they do not contain student names or
identifiers.

Generic feedback templates that you have created.

Module materials that are not specific to any student.

Statistical records that have been anonymised so no student can be identified.

================================================================================
SECTION 6: WHAT YOU MUST NOT KEEP
================================================================================

You must not keep the following:

Named grade lists showing student names with their marks.

Individual student records of any kind.

Personal correspondence with students.

Performance data that can identify individual students.

================================================================================
SECTION 7: DATA BREACH REPORTING
================================================================================

If you discover or suspect a data breach, take these steps immediately:

Step 1: Report the breach immediately to the Open University Data Protection
team. Do not delay this step.

Step 2: Note what data was affected. Make a list of the types of information
that may have been compromised.

Step 3: Identify how the breach occurred. Try to understand what happened.

Step 4: Follow any instructions you receive from the Open University.

================================================================================
SECTION 8: GOLDEN RULES TO REMEMBER
================================================================================

Rule 1: If you have not used a student file in the past year and the module
has finished, delete it.

Rule 2: When you are uncertain whether to keep or delete data, delete it.
You can always request data from the Open University if you later need it.

Rule 3: It is easier to explain why you deleted data than to explain why you
kept it longer than necessary.
