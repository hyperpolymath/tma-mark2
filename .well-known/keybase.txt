# Keybase was acquired by Zoom (May 2020) and effectively abandoned.
# This file remains as a memorial to federated identity verification
# that could have been.

# For identity verification, see:
# - /.well-known/did.json (W3C Decentralized Identifiers)
# - /.well-known/webfinger (RFC 7033)
# - Repository signed commits
