== Overview

[cols="1,3"]
|===
|Tool |Purpose

|eTMA Handler
|For *tutors* marking student submissions

|eTMA Monitor
|For *monitors* checking the quality of tutors' marking
|===

These two tools work together to make marking and monitoring more effective, though they are separate products.

== Original Code Analysis

*Source*: `etmaMonitorEmbedJavaMacSP.zip` (Mike Hay's version 2.1.1NU)

*Main class*: `EtmaMonitorJ.java` (~8,400 lines)

*Technical debt*: Same patterns as eTMA Handler
- Monolithic Swing application
- 130+ anonymous inner classes
- XML-based data storage
- Jazzy spell checking (legacy library)
- Tightly coupled UI/logic

== Key Features

=== Monitoring Rubric
The default rubric for evaluating tutors' marking:

. Acknowledges good work
. Provides encouragement and support
. Suggests ways of improving future work
. Corrects and explains errors and omissions
. Makes clear and constructive comments
. Directs student to course materials
. Clearly explains where marks were gained or lost

=== Categories
* *Marking*: Too high / Appropriate / Too low
* *Commenting*: Meets or exceeds requirements / Requires further exploration

== Modernisation Status

[NOTE]
====
Like eTMA Handler, this is legacy code maintained for reference.
The modernised version is in the main tma-mark2 codebase.

See `../docs/IDEAS.md` for modernisation roadmap.
