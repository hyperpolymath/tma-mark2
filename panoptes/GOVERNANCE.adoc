== Overview

Panoptes follows a benevolent dictator for life (BDFL) governance model with a core team structure. This document outlines how decisions are made and how the project is managed.

== Roles

=== BDFL (Benevolent Dictator For Life)

The BDFL has final authority on all project decisions. This role is responsible for:

* Setting overall project direction
* Resolving disputes
* Appointing core team members
* Making final decisions when consensus cannot be reached

=== Core Team

Core team members are trusted contributors with significant responsibilities:

* Merge permissions on the repository
* Release management
* Issue triage
* Community moderation
* Mentoring new contributors

Current core team members are listed in link:MAINTAINERS.md[MAINTAINERS.md].

=== Contributors

Anyone who has contributed to the project through:

* Code contributions
* Documentation improvements
* Bug reports
* Feature suggestions
* Community support

=== Users

The community of people who use Panoptes. User feedback is essential for guiding development priorities.

== Decision Making

=== Lazy Consensus

Most decisions are made through lazy consensus:

1. Proposal is made (issue, PR, or discussion)
2. Reasonable time for feedback (typically 72 hours)
3. If no objections, proposal is accepted
4. Silence is consent

=== Voting

For significant decisions where consensus cannot be reached:

* Core team members have voting rights
* Simple majority required
* BDFL has tie-breaking vote
* Voting period: 7 days

=== Escalation

When disputes arise:

1. Discussion among involved parties
2. Core team mediation
3. BDFL final decision

== Contribution Process

=== Code Contributions

1. Fork and create feature branch
2. Implement changes with tests
3. Submit pull request
4. Core team review
5. Address feedback
6. Merge upon approval

=== Becoming a Core Team Member

Core team members are invited based on:

* Sustained, quality contributions
* Demonstrated understanding of project goals
* Positive community interactions
* Commitment to the project

Process:

1. Nomination by existing core team member
2. Discussion among core team
3. Lazy consensus or vote
4. BDFL approval

== Release Process

=== Version Numbering

We follow Semantic Versioning (SemVer):

* MAJOR: Breaking changes
* MINOR: New features, backward compatible
* PATCH: Bug fixes, backward compatible

=== Release Schedule

* Patch releases: As needed
* Minor releases: Approximately monthly
* Major releases: As needed for breaking changes

=== Release Checklist

1. All tests passing
2. Documentation updated
3. CHANGELOG.md updated
4. Security review (for major releases)
5. Core team approval
6. Tag and publish

== Communication

=== Official Channels

* GitHub Issues: Bug reports, feature requests
* GitHub Discussions: Questions, ideas
* Discord: Real-time community chat

=== Meetings

* Monthly core team sync (optional)
* Ad-hoc meetings for significant decisions
* Notes published in discussions

== Changes to Governance

This governance document may be changed by:

1. Proposal via pull request
2. Two-week discussion period
3. Core team vote (⅔ majority)
4. BDFL approval

== Code of Conduct

All participants must follow our link:CODE_OF_CONDUCT.adoc[Code of Conduct].

== Attribution

This governance model is inspired by various open source projects including Python, Rust, and Node.js.
