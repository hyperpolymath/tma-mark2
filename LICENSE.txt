PALIMPSEST PHILOSOPHICAL OVERLAY (v0.5)
================================================================================

In addition to the AGPL-3.0-or-later license, this project adopts the
Palimpsest philosophical framework. While the AGPL provides the legal
foundation, Palimpsest articulates our ethical commitments:

Core Principles:
  1. CONSENT - Explicit permission for AI training and derivative works
  2. ATTRIBUTION - Preserve the chain of creation and contribution
  3. COMPASSION - Technology should reduce suffering, not amplify it
  4. REVERSIBILITY - Actions should be undoable where possible
  5. TRANSPARENCY - No hidden behaviors or undisclosed data collection

The Palimpsest principles are not legally binding beyond what the AGPL
requires, but represent the spirit in which this software is offered.

Philosophy: "Copyleft with compassion"

1. EDUCATIONAL USE EXCEPTION
   Academic institutions may run this software for non-commercial educational
   purposes without the network disclosure requirement of AGPL Section 13,

   - No commercial services are built upon it
   - This exception does not extend to modifications or derivatives

2. INTEROPERABILITY EXCEPTION
   Linking with the Open University's official APIs or data formats does not
