== Overview

The MAA (Mutually Assured Accountability) framework ensures that all participants in the eTMA Handler project are accountable for their contributions and decisions.

== Core Principles

=== 1. Transparent Decision Making

All significant decisions must be:

* Documented in ADRs (Architecture Decision Records)
* Discussed in public forums (GitHub Issues/Discussions)
* Reviewed by at least one other contributor

=== 2. Traceable Contributions

Every change must:

* Reference an issue or discussion
* Include clear commit messages
* Pass automated checks

=== 3. Shared Responsibility

No single person bears sole responsibility:

* Code reviews required for all merges
* Multiple maintainers for critical paths
* Succession planning documented

4. Public disclosure after fix

=== Data Loss Incidents

1. Immediate investigation
2. Root cause analysis
3. Prevention measures documented
4. User communication if affected

== Audit Trail

=== Required Records

* All merged pull requests
* All closed issues with resolution
* All ADRs with rationale
* All security advisories

=== Retention

* Git history: Permanent
* Issue discussions: Permanent
* Security reports: 5 years
* Audit logs: 2 years

== Compliance Verification

=== Self-Assessment

Quarterly review of:

* [ ] All PRs have reviews
