== Executive Summary

This report documents the forensic analysis of a Microsoft Word document (DOCX) that was subject to post-creation modification through programmatic injection of comment annotations. The analysis demonstrates the perturbation signatures left behind by such modifications and assesses the detectability of the alterations.

*Key Findings:*

1. The examined file shows clear evidence of modification after its original creation
2. Comment annotations were injected using non-standard tooling (not Microsoft Word)
3. Multiple forensic artifacts reveal the timing, method, and content of modifications
4. The modifications are *not covert* - they are fully transparent to forensic examination

*Conclusion:* The file modifications are readily detectable through standard forensic techniques. No attempt at concealment was made.

== Technical Background

=== DOCX File Format

Microsoft Word documents (.docx) use the Office Open XML (OOXML) format, which is a ZIP archive containing multiple XML files:

[source]
----
document.docx
├── [Content_Types].xml      # MIME type registry
├── _rels/.rels              # Root relationships
├── docProps/
│   ├── core.xml             # Document metadata
│   ├── app.xml              # Application info
│   └── custom.xml           # Custom properties
└── word/
    ├── document.xml         # Main content
    ├── styles.xml           # Style definitions
    ├── comments.xml         # Comment annotations (if present)
    └── _rels/
        └── document.xml.rels  # Content relationships
----

=== Modification Vector

Comments in DOCX files require modifications to four components:

1. `[Content_Types].xml` - Register comment content type
2. `word/_rels/document.xml.rels` - Add relationship reference
3. `word/comments.xml` - Create comment content (new file)
4. `word/document.xml` - Insert comment range markers

== Forensic Analysis

=== Finding 1: File Size Discrepancy

[cols="2,1,1"]
|===
| Metric | Original | Modified

| File size (bytes)
| 15,970
| 17,801

| Size increase
| —
| +1,831 bytes (+11.5%)

| Contained files
| 19
| 20
|===

*Significance:* The 11.5% size increase is consistent with the addition of comment annotations. A new file (`comments.xml`) was created and existing files were enlarged.

=== Finding 2: ZIP Timestamp Analysis

The DOCX container exhibits two distinct timestamp clusters:

==== Timestamp Cluster A (Original Content)
[source]
----
01-02-2026 15:11   word/theme/theme1.xml
01-02-2026 15:11   word/fontTable.xml
01-02-2026 15:11   word/header1.xml
01-02-2026 15:11   word/header2.xml
01-02-2026 15:11   word/header3.xml
01-02-2026 15:11   word/settings.xml
01-02-2026 15:11   word/styles.xml
01-02-2026 15:11   docProps/core.xml
01-02-2026 15:11   docProps/app.xml
01-02-2026 15:11   docProps/custom.xml
01-02-2026 15:11   _rels/.rels
----

==== Timestamp Cluster B (Modified Content)
[source]
----
01-06-2026 03:07   word/comments.xml          ← NEW FILE
01-06-2026 03:08   [Content_Types].xml        ← MODIFIED
01-06-2026 03:08   word/_rels/document.xml.rels  ← MODIFIED
01-06-2026 03:09   word/document.xml          ← MODIFIED
----

*Significance:* The bifurcated timestamp pattern conclusively demonstrates post-creation modification. Files in Cluster B were touched 4 days after the original save date.

=== Finding 3: Metadata Inconsistency

The document metadata in `docProps/core.xml` shows:

[source,xml]
----
<dcterms:created>2025-11-27T11:38:00Z</dcterms:created>
<dc:creator>Holly Stroyan</dc:creator>
<cp:lastModifiedBy>Jonathan D.A. Jewell</cp:lastModifiedBy>
<dcterms:modified>2026-01-02T15:11:38Z</dcterms:modified>
----

*Anomaly Detected:* The `dcterms:modified` timestamp (2026-01-02T15:11:38Z) does not match the ZIP timestamps of modified files (2026-01-06 03:07-03:09). Microsoft Word would update this field on save.

*Conclusion:* The modification was performed by a tool other than Microsoft Word.

=== Finding 4: Comment Injection Artifacts

==== 4.1 New File Creation

A new file `word/comments.xml` was created containing:

[source,xml]
----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="yes"?>
<w:comments xmlns:w="http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/wordprocessingml/2006/main"
            xmlns:r="http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/officeDocument/2006/relationships">
  <w:comment w:id="0"
             w:author="Jonathan Jewell"
             w:date="2026-01-06T12:00:00Z"
             w:initials="JJ">
    <w:p>
      <w:r>
        <w:t>Typo: should be "Barr" (with two r's)</w:t>
      </w:r>
    </w:p>
  </w:comment>
  <w:comment w:id="1"
             w:author="Jonathan Jewell"
             w:date="2026-01-06T12:00:00Z"
             w:initials="JJ">
    <w:p>
      <w:r>
        <w:t>Same typo in reference list - should be "Barr &amp; Hayne"</w:t>
      </w:r>
    </w:p>
  </w:comment>
</w:comments>
----

*Observations:*

- Author explicitly identified: "Jonathan Jewell"
- Timestamps hardcoded to 12:00:00Z (noon UTC) - unnaturally precise
- Two comments injected with sequential IDs (0, 1)
- Content clearly visible and readable

==== 4.2 Content Type Registration

Added to `[Content_Types].xml`:

[source,xml]
----
<Override PartName="/word/comments.xml"
          ContentType="application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.comments+xml"/>
----

==== 4.3 Relationship Addition

Added to `word/_rels/document.xml.rels`:

[source,xml]
----
<Relationship Id="rId13"
              Type="http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/officeDocument/2006/relationships/comments"
              Target="comments.xml"/>
----

*Observation:* The relationship ID `rId13` follows sequentially after existing relationships (rId1-rId12), consistent with programmatic addition.

==== 4.4 Document XML Markers

Comment range markers were inserted into `word/document.xml`:

[source,xml]
----
<!-- Injection pattern around "Bars" text -->
...adult. </w:t></w:r>
<w:commentRangeStart w:id="0"/>
<w:r><w:rPr><w:rFonts w:cs="Times New Roman" w:ascii="Times New Roman" w:hAnsi="Times New Roman"/></w:rPr>
<w:t>Bars</w:t></w:r>
<w:commentRangeEnd w:id="0"/>
<w:r><w:commentReference w:id="0"/></w:r>
<w:r><w:rPr>...
----

*Structural Anomalies Detected:*

1. Run properties (`<w:rPr>`) duplicated around injection point
2. Text node split mid-sentence
3. No revision tracking attributes (`w:rsidR`, `w:rsidRPr`)
4. Comment reference in separate run element

=== Finding 5: Missing Word Signatures

Microsoft Word adds tracking attributes to modified content:

[cols="2,1,1"]
|===
| Signature | Expected (Word) | Found (This File)

| `w:rsidR` (revision ID for run)
| Present
| *Absent*

| `w:rsidRPr` (revision ID for properties)
| Present
| *Absent*

| Revision history in `settings.xml`
| Updated
| *Unchanged*

| `core.xml` modification time
| Updated
| *Unchanged*
|===

*Conclusion:* The absence of these signatures confirms the modification was performed by non-Word tooling.

== Conclusions

=== Primary Conclusions

1. **Modification Confirmed:** The examined file was modified after its last save in Microsoft Word.

2. **Method Identified:** Comments were injected programmatically using command-line tools (sed, zip) rather than Microsoft Word.

3. **Content Identified:** Two comment annotations were added, both noting a spelling error ("Bars" should be "Barr").

4. **Attribution:** The comments are attributed to "Jonathan Jewell" with timestamps of 2026-01-06.

5. **No Concealment:** No attempt was made to hide the modifications. All perturbation signatures are clearly visible.

=== Forensic Detectability Assessment

[cols="3,1"]

| Detection Method | Effectiveness

| File size comparison
| HIGH

| ZIP timestamp analysis
| HIGH

| Metadata comparison

| XML structural analysis

| Content extraction
| TRIVIAL
|===

*Overall Assessment:* The modifications are *trivially detectable* through standard forensic examination. This is consistent with legitimate annotation activity rather than covert tampering.

== Recommendations

1. **For Document Integrity:** Implement cryptographic hashing at document receipt (ingress) and return (egress) to create chain of custody records.

2. **For Tamper Detection:** Use RFC 3161 timestamping for legally admissible proof of document state at specific times.

3. **For Tool Development:** If programmatic comment injection is required, consider updating document metadata to reduce forensic anomalies.
