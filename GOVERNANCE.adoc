== Overview

eTMA Handler follows a BDFL (Benevolent Dictator For Life) governance model with a core team structure.

== Roles

=== BDFL

The BDFL has final authority on project decisions:

* Set project direction
* Resolve disputes
* Appoint core team members
* Must maintain succession plan

=== Core Team

Core team members (see MAINTAINERS.md):

* Merge permissions
* Release management
* Security response
* Architecture decisions

=== Contributors

All levels as defined in CONTRIBUTING.adoc (TPCF Perimeters 1-3).

== Decision Making

=== Lazy Consensus

Most decisions use lazy consensus:

1. Proposal made (issue/PR/discussion)
2. Review period (72 hours standard, 14 days for breaking changes)
3. No blocking objections = accepted

=== Voting

When consensus fails:

* Core team votes
* Simple majority required
* BDFL breaks ties
* 7-day voting period

== Succession Planning

=== BDFL Succession

* Designated successor documented
* Triggers: resignation, 6-month inactivity, ⅔ removal vote
* 30-day transition period

=== Core Team

* Nomination by existing Core member
* 14-day discussion
* BDFL approval
* Emeritus status for departing members

== Release Management

=== Versioning

Semantic Versioning (SemVer):

* MAJOR: Breaking changes
* MINOR: New features
* PATCH: Bug fixes

=== Release Authority

* Patch: Any Core member
* Minor: Two Core members
* Major: Core consensus + BDFL

== Financial Transparency

See FUNDING.yml for funding sources.

Funds used for:

* Infrastructure
* Security audits
* Documentation

Quarterly reports in Discussions.

== Amendments

Changes to this document require:

1. RFC with 30-day discussion
