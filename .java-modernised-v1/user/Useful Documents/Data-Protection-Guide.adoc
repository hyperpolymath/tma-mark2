2. Choose option **5) Data protection: Sanitise student data**
3. Follow the prompts to:
   * Preview what will be deleted
   * Delete specific courses
   * Delete all student data
   * Delete the returns folder

=== Safe Deletion Steps

[source]
----
Step 1: Verify all marked work has been uploaded to OU
Step 2: Run the sanitisation tool in preview mode
Step 3: Confirm the files are no longer needed
Step 4: Delete by course or all at once
----

== Manual Deletion

If you prefer to delete manually:

=== Location of Files

Student data is typically stored in:

* `~/etmas/` (default location)
* Course folders: `DD210-25J/`, `E225-25J/`, etc.
* Returns folder: `~/etmas/returns/`

=== What to Delete

* All `.fhi` files (eTMA submission files)
* All `.pt3` files (PT3 feedback forms)
* All `.doc`, `.docx`, `.odt` files (student submissions)
* All `.pdf` files (if student work)
* All `.zip` files in returns folder

=== Secure Deletion

For additional security, you can use the `shred` command:

[source,bash]
----
# Securely delete a file (overwrites data)
shred -u filename.fhi

# Securely delete all files in a folder
find ~/etmas/DD210-24J -type f -exec shred -u {} \;
----

== Record Keeping

=== What You MAY Keep

* Your own teaching notes (without student identifiers)
* Generic feedback templates
* Module materials (not student-specific)
* Statistical records (anonymised)

=== What You MUST NOT Keep

* Named grade lists
* Individual student records
* Personal correspondence with students
* Identifiable performance data

== Annual Review Checklist

* [ ] Identify courses where students have completed
* [ ] Verify all marked work has been uploaded
* [ ] Delete data for completed courses
* [ ] Empty the returns folder

== Summary

[TIP]
====
**Golden Rule:** If you haven't used a student file in the past year and the module has finished, delete it.

**When in doubt:** Delete. You can always request data from the OU if needed.

**Remember:** It's easier to explain why you deleted data than why you kept it.
